                            Thank you for being there even though Im not the best of person...
                            I also thank you for listening to my bullshit rambling about my life problems.
                            I feel lucky to meet you, thank you for everything. nothing can make me as happy as you. One thing I love about you is how you want me to be happy, even at an extremely low point you wanted to make me laugh and you did many times. I like you more every day.

                            Honestly, you mean so much to me. You know what makes me so sure it’s you? It’s you because of the way you make me smile and the way you make me laugh. When I was down you knew how to cheer me up. I know it’s you because I have never felt so safe and loved. No matter how goofy I am you still love me for who I am, you don’t judge me when I’m being weird. You taught me how to love myself without even knowing how to love yourself. When I first started talking to you it felt like I had known you for years and I had such an instant connection with you, it was like I found my soulmate or my missing piece. It’s you because out of all the people in my life, it just wouldn’t be the same without you, I trust you and love you with all my heart, I couldn’t imagine a future that you are not in. It will always be you, forever and always.
                            You’re the best person I’ve ever met and I don’t how I describe you. I Love You So Much &#10084
